### **Session 1**

This project is at its initial stage. So far, the project structure has been set up and the foundational files have been created. The current focus is on outlining the milestones and planning the implementation steps for the attendance system.

### **Session 2**

- Defined `Student` class with `studentId`, `name`, `setDetails()`, and `displayDetails()` method.
- Defined `Course` class with `courseId`, `courseName`, `setDetails()`, and `displayDetails()` method.
- Utilized arrays of objects in `Main.java` to manage and display multiple students and courses.
- Introduced basic usage of `this` keyword.

### **Session 3**

- Implemented constructors in the `Student` and `Course` classes to streamline object creation.
- Automated the assignment of `studentId` and `courseId` using counters to ensure unique identification.
- Simplified object instantiation in `Main.java` by removing arrays and directly creating and displaying student and course objects.

### **Session 4**

- Created a new `Attendance` class to manage attendance records, including student ID, course ID, and attendance status.
- Added validation in the `Attendance` class to ensure the status is either "Present" or "Absent."
- Enhanced the `Student` and `Course` classes with getter methods to provide controlled access to their properties.
- Updated `Main.java` to integrate the `Attendance` class, allowing for the creation and display of attendance records.
